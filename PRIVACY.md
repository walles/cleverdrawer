# Privacy Policy

CleverDrawer never stores nor transmits, but does collect the following kinds
of data for local processing and storage on the Android device only:
* Information about your contacts

## Anonymous Statistics

Anonymous statistics data is transmitted to
[Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics) and stored for
being able to know what improvements are needed to the app.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of examples of what is tracked:
* Stack traces from crashes; what lines of code / functions were being executed
during the crash. No personally identifiable information is ever part of this
data. This is to be able to give users a crash-free experience.

## Optional Launch History

Optionally, users can on their own initiative click the "Contact
Developer" button. This will let the user compose an e-mail to the
developer. By default, this e-mail has an attachment with the user's
launch history. This launch history does contains app identifiers with
launch timestamps, so it is obvious which apps the user has launched.

The file also includes a number for each contact, which is valid only
for the user's device, so this number can *not* be used by the developer
to identify any of the user's contacts.

If the user feels uncomfortable sharing this information with the
developer, they can just remove the attachment before sending the mail.
