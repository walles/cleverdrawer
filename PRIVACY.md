# Privacy Policy

CleverDrawer never stores nor transmits, but does collect the following kinds
of data for local processing and storage on the Android device only:
* Information about your contacts

## Anonymous Statistics

Anonymous statistics data is transmitted to <https://fabric.io> and stored for
being able to know what improvements are needed to the app.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of examples of what is tracked:
* Stack traces from crashes; what lines of code / functions were being executed
during the crash. No personally identifiable information is ever part of this
data. This is to be able to give users a crash-free experience.
* Number of apps having been launched through the app
* Apps with duplicate names. This is to be able to provide users with unique app
names so users know which "Settings" (for example) it is they are launching
* Statistics about what users respond to the request for `READ_CONTACTS`
permission. This is to be able to experiment with better explaining that we want
to list contacts.
